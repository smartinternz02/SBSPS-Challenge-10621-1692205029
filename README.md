## Identifying Patterns and Trends in Campus Placement Data using Machine Learning 
 
The Placement Prediction Flask App is a web application designed to predict the likelihood of placement for students based on various factors. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze student data and provide accurate placement predictions. 
 
## Features 
 
- **Easy Data Input**: Users can input student information such as demographics, education background, and other relevant details. 
- **Prediction Generation**: The app generates predictions using trained machine learning models, providing insights into the likelihood of student placement. 
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The Flask app offers a user-friendly interface, making it simple for users to interact with and obtain predictions. 
- **Flexible Deployment**: The app can be easily deployed on both cloud servers and local servers, allowing for convenient access and utilization. 
 
## How It Works 
 
1. Users input student information through the app's interface. 
2. The app processes the input data and passes it to the trained machine learning models. 
3. The models analyze the data and generate predictions based on the provided features. 
4. The app displays the placement prediction results to the user. 
 
## Dataset 
 
The app utilizes a dataset called "Placement Dataset.csv" for training the machine learning models. This dataset contains relevant features and corresponding placement outcomes for a set of students. 
 
## Installation and Deployment 
 
To install and deploy the Placement Prediction Flask App, follow these steps: 
 
1. Clone the repository. 
2. Open the deployment file in a PyCharm environment. No changes are required as all dependencies are already installed in the provided file. 
3. If you want to run the local server-based project, ensure that the version dependencies mentioned in the requirements.txt match the dependencies installed in the project file.
